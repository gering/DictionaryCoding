# DictionaryCoding

This is an implementation of Swift's Encoder/Decoder protocols which uses `NSDictionary` as its underlying container mechanism.

It allows you to take a native swift class or struct that confirms to the Codable protocol and convert it to, or initialise it from, a dictionary.

A lot of the code is actually taken from the Swift Foundation library's own `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes.

It turns out that those class actually work by using `NSDictionary` as an intermediate step between JSON and the native type to be encoded/decoded. Unfortunately the underlying `NSDictionary` support isn't exposed by Foundation, which is why I've done so here.

See [this blog post](http://elegantchaos.com/2018/02/21/decoding-dictionaries-in-swift.html) for a bit more detail!

### Build Instructions

At the moment this module is best built using the Swift Package Manager with `swift build`.

The unit tests can be run with `swift test`.

An Xcode project can be generated with `swift package generate-xcodeproj  --xcconfig-overrides DictionaryCoding.xcconfig`.

A CocoaPods `.podspec` file is included. I don't use CocoaPods myself though, so I can't be entirely sure that I haven't broken something (or forgotten to update something).

Please file issues (or even better, pull requests) for support for other build systems.
